# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Next Auth
# You can generate a new secret on the command line with:
# npx auth secret
# https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options#secret
AUTH_SECRET=""

# Next Auth Microsoft Entra ID Provider
# https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/microsoft-entra-id

# Tenant ID ->  copy from Directory (tenant) ID
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ISSUER="https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT ID>/v2.0" 

# Application (client) ID → copy from Application (client) ID
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID="<Application (client) ID>"

# App secret for auth
# In the left menu of the dashboard, click Certificates & secrets.
# Under Client secrets, click New client secret.
# Add a description (e.g. NextAuth Secret) and choose an expiry (e.g. 6 months, 12 months).
# Click Add.
# Copy the Value (not the Secret ID!) immediately — you won’t be able to see it again later.
# You will need to rotate this secret periodically 
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_SECRET="<Client secret value>"

# Prisma
# https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls#env
# This is the main connection string Prisma uses for running queries and such
# Typically points to your database through a connection pooler 
# (e.g. PgBouncer, Supabase proxy, Neon’s pooled endpoint).
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/student-solver-tool"

# This var is mostly used when Prisma needs direct, unpooled access to the database.
# Some cloud providers (Neon, Supabase, Render, etc.) require you to hit the 
# direct database endpoint for migrations and the pooled endpoint for runtime queries.
# If you don’t have a connection pooler (e.g. local dev),
# you can just set both the DATABASE_URL and DIRECT_URL to the same value
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/student-solver-tool"

# List of coordinator emails, separated by commas.
# This dictates who falls under the coordinator role.
