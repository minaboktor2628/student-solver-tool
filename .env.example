# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Next Auth
# You can generate a new secret on the command line with:

# Application (client) ID → copy from Application (client) ID
AUTH_MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_ID="<Application (client) ID>"

# App secret for auth
# In the left menu of the dashboard, click Certificates & secrets.
# Under Client secrets, click New client secret.
# Add a description (e.g. NextAuth Secret) and choose an expiry (e.g. 6 months, 12 months).
