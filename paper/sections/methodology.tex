\section{Methodology} % Introduce our overall scrum process - agile development. Creating new small issues often, assigning them to iterations, usable small pieces of software being developed - also mention our software development environment - github
To ensure rapid development while also having the ability to adjust to new requirements we decided to use the agile scrum methodology. This methodology is a flexible, iterative approach that ensures continuous improvement. This framework also allows our advisors to request new frequent changes to our project during weekly meetings. During agile development, chunks of work are split up into sections called sprints. The goal of a sprint is to produce a feature of the project. We utilized the GitHub issues page to help organize our sprints into iterations and then those iterations into tasks that we could complete. Frequent scrum meetings were held to provide a structured opportunity for team members to report progress, share challenges, and align on next steps. This allowed the team to identify and resolve problems that slowed down development quickly. This iterative cycle enabled us to adapt to changes in requirements and incorporate feedback regularly. By emphasizing continuous delivery and collaborative decision-making, this approach supported the efficient development of the project deliverables.
