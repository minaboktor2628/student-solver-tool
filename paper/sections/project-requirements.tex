\section{Project Requirements}
Our group was tasked to come up with a solution for the current problem surrounding the TA/PLA placement process. In Professor Ahrens' previous TA/PLA Placement workflow he would need to manually place every student assistant and then manually validate his solution. This process would take hours to complete a valid solution and there was no guarantee the solution was truly valid due to human error. \par
The goal of the project was to create a solver that would automatically create valid solutions for student assistant placements. In this workflow a solver would take in course data, professor preferences and student assistant preferences and then create an optimal solution. From this point the coordinator would then be able to make manual adjustments that the solver would not be able to handle. \par
Our main project requirement for A-term was to create a TA/PLA assignment validator for Professor Ahrens. This validator would allow him to upload an excel sheet with TA and PLA assignments and our application would either validate the solution or throw errors with short descriptions of what failed. Splitting up the requirement into this smaller goal for our A-term deliverable allows us to take a stronger look at each specific step that would need to take place during the entire solver workflow. This smaller validator goal will help ensure future success by creating digestible chunks of work to be completed before the final solver is complete.  \par
