\section{Future Works} % What we should be working on in B-term
Our main project requirement for A-term was to create a TA/PLA assignment validator for Professor Ahrens. This validator would allow him to upload an excel sheet with TA and PLA assignments and our application would either validate the solution or throw errors with short descriptions of what failed. \par
In Professor Ahrens' previous TA/PLA Placement workflow he would need to manually place every student assistant and then manually validate his solution. This process would take hours to complete a valid solution and there was no guarantee the solution was truly valid due to human error.
